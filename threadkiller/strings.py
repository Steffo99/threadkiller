start = """👋 Hi, I'm Threadkiller!

I'm a bot designed to keep all messages in a group inside of a reply thread.

To use my features, <a href="https://t.me/{bot_name}?startgroup=yes">add me to a group</a>!

If you give me the <b>Delete Messages</b> permission, I will delete all messages sent outside of reply threads, otherwise, I'll just notify the senders.

If you add me to a <b>channel discussion group</b>, I will suggest that your senders use the Comment feature of your channel.

If you give me the <b>Pin Messages</b> permission, I will pin all messages starting with /thread.

Be aware that by using me, it might become impossible to forward messages in the group, since messages <u>cannot be forwarded inside threads</u>.
